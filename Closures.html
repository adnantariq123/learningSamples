<body>
   <p>a <b>closure</b> gives you access to an <u>outer function's scope</u> from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are 
    created every time a function is created, at function creation time. ... The inner function will have access to the variables in the outer function scope, even after the outer function has returned.</p>

/* as i understand them, Closures are functions inside functions??? UPDATE: WRONG(Kinda) CLOSURES are varaiables/parameters 
that a functions looks for OUTSIDE it's scope(outside it's block) when it needs that variable or parameter

and because in js function are also object... `passed` parameter is avaliable at function xyz

javascript has lexical scoping: that is varialbe that is defined outside your scrope is automatically avalaible inside 
*/

var addTo = function (passed) {

    var xyz= function (inner) {
        console.log("Arguement passed : "+ passed);
        console.log("Arguement inner : "+ inner);
        return passed * inner;
    }

    return xyz;

}

var addSomething = new addTo(100);
var somethingSomething = new addTo(100);


//console.log(addSomething(2));
console.log(somethingSomething(5));





let fff =() => {
    let i =1;
    let j = 2;
    // at return we made another function
    return () => {
        //i should be avaliable. J is not BECAUSE we are not using it
        // but if you did console.log(J); then you would have a second closure
        console.log(" i: " +i);
    }
}

fff();

//console.dir(fff());

for (let i =0; i<3; i++) {
    const f = () => {
        console.log(i);
    }
