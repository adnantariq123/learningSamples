    <title>difference between old function and Arrow function Syntax</title>

<body>
    <p>JavaScript has <b>first-class functions</b>, meaning that functions is treated like any other first-class object â€” they can be stored in variables, passed around, returned from other functions, and even hold their own properties.</p>
    <p>In Javascript, functions are values ( first-class citizens ). This means that they can be assigned to a variable and/or passed as a value.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be stored in a variable;</li>
        <li>Be passed as arguments to functions;</li>
        <li>Be returned by functions;</li>
       

    </ul>

    <BR>

    <p>What is <b>higher order function</b> in JS?</p>
    <p>Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results. Taking an other function as an argument is often referred as a callback function, because it is called back by the higher-order function</p>

    <ul>
        <li> we can take one function and put it into another function</li>
        <li>and many more ..</li>
    </ul>

// older samples of the way we write functions vs arrow functions 


// you can even define the parameter right away
cooler =(x,y=9) => {
    return x+y;
}
 console.log(cooler(5));



//example 1
    function sum (a,b) {
        return(a+b);
    }

    let sumArrow = (a,b) => a+b






// example 2
    //this is a simple boolean to check if number is positve or not, so -5 would show up as FALSE
    function isPositive(number) {
        return number >=0;
    }

// IMPORTANT and because this function has only ONE parameter 
// we don't even need parenthises around the parameter number
    let PositiveArrow = number => number >=0

/* NOW this same ending line above ("number >=0") could be written as 
    {
        return number * 2; BUT you have to use the return keyword or yur fucked
    }*/






// example 3
    function ggRandom() {
        return Math.random()
    }

    let randomArrow = () => Math.random()



//example 4
document.addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log("I AM CLICKING HERE");
})


document.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log("I AM CLICKING HERE WITH ARROWS!!! >_<");
})




// AND what is the difference

class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name
    }

    printNameFunction () {
        // so the "old " style of function the this keyword is different.. it define this where the function was called
        // so in this case with in this function only \/
        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log("coming from regualr function :" + this.name)
            //console.log("\n");
        }, 500)
    }

    printNameArrow () {
        // while the arrow function the scoping of the "THIS"
        // in the case of the ARROW function the "THIS does not get redefined "... which is a good thing ^-^
        setTimeout (() => {
            console.log("Arrow way :" + this.name)
        }, 500)
    }

    // IN OTHER WORDS... USE ARROW FUNCTIONS!!!


};

let bbb = new Person("bobby");

bbb.printNameFunction();
bbb.printNameArrow();
